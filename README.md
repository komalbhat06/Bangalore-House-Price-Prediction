A machine learning regression project was developed wherein I have learned and obtained
several insights about regression models and how they are developed. The various benefits that
machine learning provides to the market have made it one of the top contenders in the current
market as the field of interest of many organizations worldwide. Most of the organizations are
already implementing machine learning technology as it generates more accurate and
consistent processes that are less prone to errors. The system uses linear regression model to
extract the data and also makes optimal use of machine learning algorithms which satisfies the
customer by providing accurate output and preventing the risk of investing in the wrong house.
